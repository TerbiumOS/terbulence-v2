## <span style="color: #32ae62;">Setup</span>

To get started its pretty easy; you only need npm (which you should have.) you just need to run the following command
```
npm i && npm start
``` 
and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) you should be good to go!
ls
If you wish to not start the server with the Bare Server Functionality you can just run `npm run dev`, its highly recommended to just run `npm start` 

For pnpm, yarn, bun, etc, the process should be very similar, just replace "npm" with the package manager of your choice.

> If you are going to static host Terbium you will need to change the bare server and you would not follow those steps. Refer to the [docs](https://github.com/z1g-project/Terbium/wiki/Deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages) for more information
