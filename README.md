To get started its pretty easy you need pnpm which can be installed by running: `npm i -g pnpm` and then just need to the run following command

```
    
and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should be good to go!

If you wish to not start the server with the Bare Server Functionality you can just run `pnpm run dev`, its highly recommended to just run `pnpm start`
